An exciting book that will leave you feeling inspired

To become the best one must fully understand the basics.

## Have an Attitude

Knowing your `attitude` in space is knowing your orientation with respect to
a certain object. Whether that object is the sun, earth, the ISS, etc.
losing control over your attitude could have a fatal outcome. Failure to
maintain your attitude in the work place can have serious consequences.
I like that Hadfield brought up the importance of knowing your attitude,
not just in general, but with respect to different objects or people. It is
important to maintain control over your attitude, especially when problems arise.
Until you are able to recognize oncoming emotions and prevent yourself from
reacting to them, you are vunerable to making rash decisions and you may leave
bad impressions on some co-workers. This is an area that I think can be tackled
through mindfulness and strong long term goals. When you keep these goals in mind
throughout your day to day life, the little things don't bother you as much.
Increasing Mindfulness is important and is promoted through, reading, meditation
and any thought provoking exercise.

## The Power of Negative Thinking

Think about the worst possible situation that can occur, think about the most
outlandish thing that can happen, are you prepared? Do you have some plan of
action? If not you should be scared. You should be worried, and you should
remedy the situation by preparing to the best of your ability. Prepare for
every meeting like the mic will be handed to you. This produces a few
benefits:
* Builds confidence
* Helps you expand your knowledge and understanding
* If the mic is actually handed to you, you are ready to shine.
Don't be afraid of thinking negatively after a mistake, or when preparing to
enter a scary situation. `Fear` is a synonym for `without knowledge`.
So be afraid, find the gaps in your knowledge base, and grow as a person.


## Sweat the Small Stuff

This comes down to respecting what you are doing and knowing that paying attention
to the little things can make a massive difference in the outcome of a situation.
`When striving for excellence there is no such thing as being over-prepared.`
Learn every detail about what you are planning to do or be involved in,
know it well enough so when people are looking for answers they know who to
turn to. Knowing the details inside and out shows a mastery, and allows for
developing a greater understanding, which allows for greater knowledge to be
built on top of that.
Study hard, prepare aggressively and respect the little details,
because when it comes down to it, whoever prepared the most, will excel the
farthest.
