## Have an Attitude

Knowing your `attitude` in space is knowing your orientation with respect to
a certain object. Whether that object is the sun, earth, the ISS, etc.
losing control over your attitude could have a fatal outcome. Failure to
maintain your attitude in the work place can have serious consequences.
I like that Hadfield brought up the importance of knowing your attitude,
not just in general, but with respect to different objects or people. It is
important to maintain control over your attitude, especially when problems arise.
Until you are able to recognize oncoming emotions and prevent yourself from
reacting to them, you are vunerable to making rash decisions and you may leave
bad impressions on some co-workers. This is an area that I think can be tackled
through mindfulness and strong long term goals. When you keep these goals in mind
throughout your day to day life, the little things don't bother you as much.
Increasing Mindfulness is important and is promoted through, reading, meditation
and any thought provoking exercise.
