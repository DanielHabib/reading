This book offers an relatively unbiased look into Elon Musk's Life.
After reading, I feel the power to take on larger projects and to set my goals even higher. The only thing between and idea
and its visualization is the dedication to get the project done. Make all decisions with the larger goal in mind, and 
don't allow for anyone to hinder your progress towards that goal. He may be brilliant and have a memory of a super genius, but what
really makes him stand out, is his ability to push to make his goals materialize, whatever the cost. 
The book delves into a fair amount of technical detail, being an engineer I couldn't get enough of. I now follow SpaceX, Tesla and
Solar City on twitter and check their sites for updates. Elon was unhappy with the worlds technological stagnation, so he spurred
a movement. Elon was never in it for the money, thats a side effect. What he wants to do is create a brighter future for humanity.
Even if he loses his fortunes, and Musk Co. is a huge bust, Elon changed the game. 
People now set their sights higher, knowing that with enough determination you really can achieve some amazing things.
